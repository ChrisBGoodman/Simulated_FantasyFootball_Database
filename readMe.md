This is a simulated database of the ESPN fantasy football web app that was created for a Database Systems project. The purpose was to create a full functioning simulated real world database with real information which could then be queried to find meaningful data.

The project includes a relational schema diagram of the tables as well html parsers we wrote to pull data for 555 NFL players to insert into the tables. In total the project totals 4755 rows of data.
